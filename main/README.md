# HOW TO RUN

1. In the terminal, type "python3 chat.py"
2. Open other terminals, type "python3 chat.py"
3. One of them will become the server. If the server is closed, one of the clients will act as a server instead.

# Area of improvements:

1. When the client becomes a server, it cannot send message anymore.
2. For now, to prevent multiple servers existing at the same time, one client becomes randomly selected to become a server.
3. When a client sends a message, he will see his message twice.
